# Experiment Factory N-back Container

![https://expfactory.github.io/expfactory/img/expfactoryticketyellow.png](https://expfactory.github.io/expfactory/img/expfactoryticketyellow.png)

This is an automated build to generate an nback task container, including the following Expfactory experiments:

 - [adaptive-n-back](https://www.github.com/expfactory-experiments/adaptive-n-back)
 - [nback-10min-animals](https://www.github.com/expfactory-experiments/nback-10min-animals)

nback-10min-animals is to be validated in [this study](https://osf.io/nzm2g) registered on OSF. 

It is generated by way of the [expfactory builder](https://expfactory.github.io/builder) by writing the names of these
library experiments into the [experiments.txt](experiments.txt) file here, and then being built and deployed to Docker
Hub via this circle CI workflow:

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/expfactory-containers/container-nback.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/expfactory-containers/container-nback)


## Usage
You can run the container as follows: 

```
docker run -d -p 80:80 vanessa/expfactory-container-nback start
```

and you will see the familiar interface to choose your task and get started. [There are many ways to deploy](https://expfactory.github.io/expfactory/usage). depending on your needs for a database and experiment selection. 


## Data Analysis

An example to run and analyze an analysis is provided in [analysis](analysis).

As an example, the container was run to deploy the two tasks, and save data to a local folder on
the filesystem at `/tmp/data`:


```bash
$ docker run -p 80:80 -v /tmp/data:/scif/data vanessa/expfactory-container-nback start
```
